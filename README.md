# Portfolio-GameCo

### Project Overview
You’re an analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, you’ve been asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.

## Key Questions
GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights you can pull from the data but
are specifically interested in these questions:
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
- Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
- How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time

## Target Audience
The audience for this project is the hypothetical company GameCo, specifically its executives who’ve asked you to gather insights. For a further sense of the “who,” please refer to the hypothetical stakeholder quotes below:

- Vice President of Marketing: “We’re always eager to know which genres of games are performing the best so we can allocate our marketing budget efficiently.”

- Chief Financial Officer: “It’s imperative that we keep tabs on competitors and what share of the market they’re gaining or losing. Part of how we communicate our success to investors is by showing how we’re able to grow our business in an area where a competitor’s business is shrinking.”

- Senior Vice President of Sales: “It’s essential that we understand swings in the market. If one market becomes more dominant over time in terms of sales, we’ll want to know so we can make sure we have a sufficient number of sales reps serving that market.”

## Dataset
The dataset was originally taken from VGChartz.com and was amended by CareerFoundry for the purposes of this project.
